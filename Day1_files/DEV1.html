            Dear Sir,

            The agenda of the camp is very clear to make them able to learn DSA concepts which 
            are very necessary for them and not only this much but we provide that assignments
            which they have to complete on time. and by this way they can get to know the theory
            part as well as they can practically do questons too which is nothing but a way to engaged
            them continously in coding indirectly they are practicing around 100 of coding questions.
            We will assure you this will be very great if maximum no. of students participated beacuse 
            we have an agenda of peer learning where all of them learn in group and help each other out 
            to reach the solution of the particular problem.
            
            Here we provide the list of motive:
